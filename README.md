## Overview

The Ball and Beam System is a classical unstable control problem widely used in control engineering education and research. The objective is to control the position of a rolling ball along a beam by adjusting the beam inclination angle through a servo motor using a closed-loop PID controller.

This project presents the complete development cycle of a real Ball and Beam prototype following the **VDI 2206 Mechatronic Design Methodology**, including:

* Mechanical Design
* CAD Modeling
* Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
* Mathematical Modeling
* PID Controller Design
* MATLAB Simulation
* Simulink Simulation
* Arduino-Based Real-Time Control
* Hardware–Software Integration
* System Identification
* Experimental Validation

# VDI 2206 Engineering Workflow

The project was developed following the VDI 2206 methodology for mechatronic systems design.

This approach integrates:

1. Requirements Definition
2. Mechanical Design
3. Electronics Design
4. Software Development
5. System Integration
6. Validation and Testing

---

# Mathematical Modeling

The Ball and Beam system behaves as a double integrator and is inherently unstable in open-loop operation.

Plant Transfer Function:

P(s) = 5.532 / s²

This characteristic requires feedback control to stabilize the ball position.

---

# Control System Design

## Open-Loop Behavior

The open-loop response demonstrates unstable system behavior where the ball position continuously diverges from the desired position.

## Root Locus Analysis

Root locus analysis was used to investigate system stability and select suitable controller parameters.

## PID Controller Design

Selected controller gains:

```matlab
Kp = 40
Ki = 5
Kd = 12
```

These values provided a good balance between:

* Fast Response
* Small Overshoot
* Zero Steady-State Error
* Acceptable Settling Time

---

## Closed-Loop Response

The PID controller successfully stabilized the system and achieved accurate ball position tracking.

# PID Tuning Analysis

## Effect of Proportional Gain (Kp)

<p align="center">
  <img src="Results/Figure_14_Kp_Effect.jpg" width="800">
</p>

Increasing Kp improves response speed but may increase overshoot.

---

## Effect of Integral Gain (Ki)

<p align="center">
  <img src="Results/Figure_15_Ki_Effect.jpg" width="800">
</p>

Increasing Ki reduces steady-state error and improves tracking accuracy.

## Effect of Derivative Gain (Kd)

<p align="center">
  <img src="Results/Figure_16_Kd_Effect.jpg" width="800">
</p>

Derivative action increases damping and reduces oscillations.
